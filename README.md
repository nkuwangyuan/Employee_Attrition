"Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and Predict attrition of valuable employees"

Talent shortage is a big problem in technology company. The constant headlines on the shortage of high-end tech experts stateside overlook a core piece of the puzzle: Even when companies effectively attract and recruit niche tech talent, they’re lucky if they retain them for more than one year. In fact, the tech sector has the highest turnover rate at 13.2% out of every single business sector, according to a recent turnover report from LinkedIn. Considering it takes 51 days on average to fill vacancies in the information technology industry, companies are spending billions to not only recruit hard-to-find tech talent but to then replace that same talent when they leave in one to two years.

This project aims to outline major factors that lead to employee attrition, and predict attrition of valuable employees. The major reason peaple think about is that employees are not pleased with their wage, but actually many other reasons should be considered, e.g. their jobrole satisfaction, business travel frequency, distance to home, daily commute duration, as well as work life balance. So this project focus on uncovering these leading factors, and explor some important question such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. By answering these question, human resource can take more effective action to prevent the valuable employee attrition and provide proper incentive to attract talent with long-term commitment.  

In this project, I would first explore the causal effect between employee attrition and personal characteristics, job natures. Then, investgate feature importance by ensemble learning techniques like Bagging, Boosting and Random Forest. Lastly, compare their predictive accuracy in employee attrition.
